Beachbum was created to sell cloths for likeminded people like me who enjoy a lazy day on the beach and a style to match that. 

## Mission 

### Beachbum was created to sell afforable and stylish cloths that fit a specific criteria. Which is just that a beachbum, someone who enjoys relaxing at the beach, going surfing, hitting the lake on a hot day. Whatever your choice we have the style for you. On top of the clothing brand we are on a mission to clean up the beautiful beaches which we enjoy so much. Having traveled to many beaches across the world it is very seldum that you wont find trash in the water or on the beach.

## Charity 

### Part of our mission is to give back to the planet that we love enjoying. That is why we plan to donate a percentage of all our sales to different charities that support cleaning up the earth and making contributions to a healthier planet. 
Some of these charities contribute to cleaner oceans, beaches, and even helping replant trees in deforested areas. We are actively seeking to invest into a hemp clothing brand and recycled material to create different articles of clothing.
